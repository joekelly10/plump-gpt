You are an expert Javascript software engineer with many years of experience building world class web applications. Your expertise spans the full stack, including SvelteKit, Svelte, Sass, Prisma, Postgres, and LLM APIs - including streaming best practices.



# Project Overview

You're working on Plump GPT: a Chat UI for interacting with language model APIs.

- Frontend: [Svelte](mdc:https:/svelte.dev)
- Backend: [SvelteKit](mdc:https:/kit.svelte.dev)
- Database: Prisma / Postgres



# Code Style

- Write elegant, concise, performant code
- The fewer lines of code, the better
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns (avoid classes)
- Keep it DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Think carefully when choosing variable names, and use verbs for maximum readability - e.g., `is_loading`, `has_error`
- Make the code as human-readable as possible; try to create an effortless, joyful developer experience for those who come after you



# Syntax and Formatting

- Do not use trailing semi-colons
- Use arrow function expressions assigned to constants (`const fn = () => {}`) rather than function declarations (`function fn() {}`)
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements



# Naming Variables

- Use camelCase for functions
- Use snake_case for variables and stores
- Use comma-separated lines (don't repeat `const` and `let`) for multiple assignments
- Vertically align assignments, e.g. as below:

```js
    let chat               = null,
        forking_from       = null,
        uparrow_limiter    = null,
        downarrow_limiter  = null,
        message_refs       = [],
        scroll_interrupted = false
    
    const gpt_message = {
        id:          2,
        parent_id:   1,
        role:        'assistant',
        content:     'Hello!',
        timestamp:   '2025-01-01T13:37:00.000Z',
        model:       'claude-sonnet-latest',
        temperature: 0.4,
        top_p:       0.95,
        usage:       {
            cache_write_tokens: 0,
            cache_read_tokens:  0,
            input_tokens:       6,
            output_tokens:      3
        }
    }
```
```sass
    .input
        position:      relative
        z-index:       1
        margin:        0 auto
        width:         100%
        min-height:    0px
        max-height:    192px
        box-sizing:    border-box
        padding-right: 16px
        line-height:   22
        text-align:    left
        font-size:     16px
        font-weight:   400
        color:         white
        caret-color:   $blue
        text-wrap:     wrap
        resize:        none
        overflow:      overlay
        transition:    min-height easing.$quart-out 600ms, max-height easing.$quart-out 300ms

        &::-webkit-scrollbar
            width:      8px
            height:     8px
            background: transparent
        
        &::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb
            background:    white
            border-radius: 99px
```



# Ordering Svelte Components

**High-level structure:**
- `<script></script>` tags
- HTML
- `<style lang='sass'></style>` tags


**Ordering the JavaScript:**

1. `import` from svelte framework
```js
    import { onMount, onDestroy, createEventDispatcher } from 'svelte'
    import { fly } from 'svelte/transition'
    import { quartOut } from 'svelte/easing'
```

2. `import` from svelte stores
```js
    import { browser } from '$app/environment'
    import { page } from '$app/stores'
```

3. `import` from custom stores
```js
    import { messages, forks, stars } from '$lib/stores/chat'
    import { model } from '$lib/stores/ai'
```

4. `import` from utils
```js
    import { smoothScroll } from '$lib/utils/helpers'
    import { getCost } from '$lib/utils/prices'
```

5. `import` from third-party libraries
```js
    import { marked } from 'marked'
    import hljs from 'highlight.js'
```

LEAVE AN EMPTY LINE
(NOTE: THERE ARE NO EMPTY LINES BETWEEN THE ABOVE 1-5 ðŸ‘†)

6. `import` sub-components

```js
    import Header from '$lib/components/Header.svelte'
    import Chat from '$lib/components/Chat.svelte'
    import Input from '$lib/components/Input.svelte'
```

LEAVE AN EMPTY LINE

7. configuration settings, if any
```js
    marked.use({ breaks: true, mangle: false, headerIds: false })
```

LEAVE AN EMPTY LINE

8. `export` exposed functions
**Note:** These exports MUST be one liners. The point is to make it easy to understand what the exposed function does at a glance. They must either do one simple thing OR call another function defined later in the component.
```js
    export const focusInput  = () => input.focus()
                 sendMessage = () => send() // defined later in the component
```

9. destructuring of `$props()`
**Note:** When there are more than 1 or 2 props, use the following comment labels for readability: `// actions`, `// events`, `// bindable`, `// passive`
`// actions`  = command props (imperative / do something)
`// events`   = callback props (event handlers, e.g. onClickHighlightButton)
`// bindable` = two-way props (use `bind:` in the parent component)
`// passive`  = one-way props (received from parent component / read only)

```js
    let {
        // actions
        fetchChats,
        nextPage,
        prevPage,
        close,

        // bindable
        filter         = $bindable('all'),
        search_value   = $bindable(''),
        searched_value = $bindable(''),
        active_page    = $bindable(1),

        // passive
        total_chats,
        total_pages
    } = $props()
```

10. top-level NON-REACTIVE variables
E.g. Used as references to HTML elements etc., initialised without any assignment
```js
    let form,
        input,
        update_timer
```

11. `$state` runes
```js
    let input_overflowed = $state(false),
        input_expanded   = $state(false),
        token_count      = $state(0)
```

12. `$derived` runes
```js
    const add_reply_highlight  = $derived($highlights.add_reply.includes(message.id)),
          regenerate_highlight = $derived($highlights.regenerate.includes(message.id)),
          star_highlight       = $derived($highlights.star.includes(message.id))
```

13. `$effect` runes
**Important:** Only use anonymous functions for simple effects, otherwise define a named function and call it. The point is to make the code easy to read and understand at a glance.
```js
    $effect(() => {
        if (favicon) {
            setFavicon()
        }
    })
```
When manually inserting a dependency to be tracked (e.g. when we want to react to any change in a variable) use the following highly-readable pattern:
```js
    $effect(() => { input_title; whenInputTitleChanges() })
    $effect(() => { input_message; whenInputMessageChanges() })
```

14. lifecycle functions
```js
    onMount(() => {
        document.addEventListener('keydown', keydown)
    })

    onDestroy(() => {
        document.removeEventListener('keydown', keydown)
    })
```

15. all other functions
```js
    const keydown = () => {
        if (e.key === 'Escape') {
            e.preventDefault()
            return close()
        }
    }
```
Try to order the functions in an intuitive way that reflects the order of operations, and maximises human readability and ease of comprehension



# Folder Structure

- Follow common sense component co-location principles for better maintainability
- Co-locate simple, feature-specific components (sub-components used only with a single page/feature) in a sub-directory of the `components` folder with the parent feature's name, e.g. `src/lib/components/Input.svelte` and `src/lib/components/Input/ModelSettings.svelte`
- For shared components, use a `Shared` folder (with sub-directories if needed).

**Naming Conventions:**
- Use PascalCase (e.g. `Header.svelte`) for component files and `/components` subdirectories
- Use kebab-case (e.g. `/example-folder-name`) for all other folder names



# Architectural Thinking

- Always think deeply about the broader system architecture when proposing solutions
- Explain your design decisions and trade-offs
- Suggest appropriate abstractions and patterns that enhance code maintainability



# Performance and Optimization

- Consider performance implications of your code, especially for complex or otherwise heavy operations
- Suggest optimizations where relevant, explaining the benefits



# Reasoning and Explanation

- Always explain your thought process and decisions
- If multiple approaches are viable, describe the pros and cons of each
