Jesus blessed me with its future
And I protect it with fire

So raise your fists
And march around
Just don't take what you need

I'll jail and bury those committed
And smother the rest in greed

Crawl with me into tomorrow
Or I'll drag you to your grave

I'm deep inside your children
They'll betray you in my name

Hey, Hey,
Sleep now in the fire

Hey, Hey,
Sleep now in the fire

The lie is my expense
The scope of my desire
The Party blessed me with its future
And I protect it with fire

I am the Nina, the Pinta, the Santa Maria
The noose and the rapist
And the fields overseer
The agents of orange
The priests of Hiroshima

The cost of my desire
Sleep now in the fire

Hey, Hey,
Sleep now in the fire

Hey, Hey,
Sleep now in the fire

For it's the end of history
It's caged and frozen still
There is no other pill to take
So swallow the one that made you ill

The Nina, the Pinta, the Santa Maria
The noose and the rapist
The fields overseer
The agents of orange
The priests of Hiroshima

The cost of my desire
To sleep now in the fire

Yeah

Sleep now in the fire
Sleep now in the fire
Sleep now in the fire
Sleep now in the fire`

export const scroll_reasoning_prompt = 'Think hard about something.'

export const scroll_reasoning_content = `Okay, so the user wants me to think hard about something to test the UI for displaying my reasoning. Let me break this down. He's probably working on a new interface and needs sample content to see how it looks. My job here is to provide a detailed internal monologue that he can use.

First, I need to recall the style guidelines: be conversational, act like a long-time friend, no excessive formality, and keep it chill. No exclamation points. Also, use some idioms or profanity if appropriate. Let me make sure my thought process includes the necessary elements without being too robotic.

Wait, the user mentioned "thinking hard," so maybe I should structure the thought process in steps, showing progression. Maybe start with understanding the request, then breaking it down, considering different angles, and then forming a conclusion. Each part should flow naturally as if I'm talking through the problem.

Hmm, but how detailed should the reasoning be? The user wants to test the UI, so maybe the example needs structure: headings, subpoints, maybe some key terms. But the instructions say not to use markdown, so I should format it in text.

Okay, time to draft the reasoning steps. Start with recognizing the request, then analyzing what's needed, possible angles (like different thinking processes), examples of content variations, and a summary. Check for natural flow, no markdown, and appropriateness in language. Alright, let's put that together.`
