export const scroll_reasoning_content = `Okay, so the user wants me to think hard about something to test the UI for displaying my reasoning. Let me break this down. He's probably working on a new interface and needs sample content to see how it looks. My job here is to provide a detailed internal monologue that he can use.

First, I need to recall the style guidelines: be conversational, act like a long-time friend, no excessive formality, and keep it chill. No exclamation points. Also, use some idioms or profanity if appropriate. Let me make sure my thought process includes the necessary elements without being too robotic.

Wait, the user mentioned "thinking hard," so maybe I should structure the thought process in steps, showing progression. Maybe start with understanding the request, then breaking it down, considering different angles, and then forming a conclusion. Each part should flow naturally as if I'm talking through the problem.

Hmm, but how detailed should the reasoning be? The user wants to test the UI, so maybe the example needs structure: headings, subpoints, maybe some key terms. But the instructions say not to use markdown, so I should format it in text.

Okay, time to draft the reasoning steps. Start with recognizing the request, then analyzing what's needed, possible angles (like different thinking processes), examples of content variations, and a summary. Check for natural flow, no markdown, and appropriateness in language. Alright, let's put that together.`
